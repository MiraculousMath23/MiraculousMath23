                Hi, My name is Lily, welcome to my Website. As I don't know what else to write I<br />
                will leave you with song lyrics and quotes from my favorite shows/books/movies/songs.<br />

            </p>
            <p>
                Take it from the top / when youre in over your head / take it from the top / push replay and start again
                /
                sometimes it might feel strange / the fact that we can change / you know / never stop ||
                I Didn't Want To Be A Halfblood. || Life is not a fairytale / but life unfolds in chapters / turn the
                page and start to make amends / theres no prewritten guarantee of happily ever afters / step into your
                greatness / before your story ends.
                || Don't be afraid to be who you are / Just scream out and shout and follow the stars / forget about the
                past that is over / we are the young ones our way is forward / who keeps tabs on stupid mistakes / we
                all mess up / but thats just the way / we learn how to get back up / we learn how to turn the page / so
                we will let our dreams take flight / and our hearts ignite / dont you know that its true / everything is
                possible / theres nothing we cant do / its a wild and beautiful fire / and i believe in you
            </p>
